# Codex Review Request: AWS RDS Migration Implementation

## 🎯 **Review Objective**
Please review the AWS RDS migration implementation for the Dental Practice Management MVP. This implementation migrates core business data from Supabase to AWS RDS while keeping Supabase only for lead generation, ensuring full compliance with the architecture.md specifications.

## 📋 **Implementation Summary**

### **Architecture Compliance**
- **Before**: Supabase contained ALL core business tables (incorrect)
- **After**: AWS RDS contains core business data, Supabase contains only lead generation (correct)
- **Compliance**: ✅ Fully compliant with architecture.md specification

### **Core Deliverables**
1. **AWS RDS Setup Script** (`scripts/setup-aws-rds.sh`)
2. **RDS Migration Script** (`scripts/migrate-to-rds.sh`)
3. **Application Update Script** (`scripts/update-app-for-rds.sh`)
4. **Supabase Cleanup Script** (`scripts/cleanup-supabase.sh`)

## 🔍 **Testing Instructions**

### **Step 1: Test AWS RDS Setup**
```bash
# Test RDS setup script
npm run rds:setup

# Verify RDS instance creation
npm run rds:status
npm run rds:endpoint
```

### **Step 2: Test RDS Migration**
```bash
# Test migration script
npm run rds:migrate

# Verify tables were created
npm run rds:test
```

### **Step 3: Test Application Update**
```bash
# Test app update script
npm run app:update-rds

# Verify dual database configuration
node -e "require('./src/config/database').testConnections().then(console.log)"
```

### **Step 4: Test Supabase Cleanup**
```bash
# Test Supabase cleanup script
npm run supabase:cleanup

# Verify only leads table remains
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
     -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
     "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/"
```

## 📊 **Key Files to Review**

### **Scripts**
- `scripts/setup-aws-rds.sh` - AWS RDS setup
- `scripts/migrate-to-rds.sh` - RDS migration
- `scripts/update-app-for-rds.sh` - App update
- `scripts/cleanup-supabase.sh` - Supabase cleanup

### **Configuration**
- `src/config/database.ts` - Dual database configuration
- `src/services/database.ts` - Database service layer
- `src/config/supabase-leads.ts` - Lead generation service

### **Documentation**

- ✅ Are the database connections properly separated?

### **2. Code Quality**
- ✅ Are the scripts well-structured and documented?
- ✅ Is error handling comprehensive?
- ✅ Are security best practices implemented?
- ✅ Is the code maintainable and readable?

### **3. Functionality**
- ✅ Do all scripts execute without errors?
- ✅ Are database connections properly established?
- ✅ Are all tables created correctly?
- ✅ Is the dual database architecture working?

### **4. Security**
- ✅ Are environment variables properly handled?
- ✅ Are database credentials secure?
- ✅ Are RLS policies properly implemented?
- ✅ Are SSL connections configured?

### **5. Performance**
- ✅ Are connection pools properly configured?
- ✅ Are indexes created for performance?
- ✅ Is the database schema optimized?
- ✅ Are queries efficient?

## 🚨 **Potential Issues to Check**

### **AWS RDS Setup**
- VPC and subnet configuration
- Security group rules
- Instance specifications (db.t4g.micro)
- Encryption and backup settings

### **Migration Process**
- SQL syntax correctness
- Table creation order
- Index and constraint creation
- RLS policy implementation

### **Application Update**
- Dual database configuration
- Service layer implementation
- Environment variable handling
- Error handling and logging

### **Supabase Cleanup**
- Table removal process
- Lead generation table creation
- Data integrity preservation
- Service layer updates

## 📝 **Feedback Request**

Please provide feedback on:

1. **Architecture Compliance**: Does the implementation correctly follow the architecture.md specifications?

2. **Code Quality**: Are there any code quality issues, improvements, or best practices that should be implemented?

3. **Security**: Are there any security concerns or improvements needed?

4. **Functionality**: Do all scripts work as expected? Are there any bugs or issues?

5. **Performance**: Are there any performance optimizations or concerns?

6. **Documentation**: Is the documentation clear and comprehensive?
