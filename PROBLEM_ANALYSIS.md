# Problem Analysis: Update Documentation with TDD Phase Guidance

## Analyze

### Problem Statement
The current documentation lacks comprehensive guidance on TDD phases and the enhanced prove system. Developers need clear instructions on how to use the TDD phase validation system, including examples, CLI commands, and troubleshooting guidance.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing TDD Phase Documentation**: The enhanced TDD enforcement system (Tasks 6-8) was implemented but documentation wasn't updated to reflect the new capabilities
2. **Lack of Examples**: Developers need concrete examples of how to use each TDD phase
3. **Missing CLI Guidance**: No documentation on how to use the prove system for TDD phase management
4. **No Troubleshooting Guide**: Developers encountering TDD validation issues have no guidance on resolution

## Identify Root Cause

### Primary Root Cause
The documentation update was not included in the original TDD phase validation implementation scope. The focus was on implementing the technical validation system (Tasks 6-8) without considering the need for comprehensive documentation to support developer adoption and usage.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Scope Creep**: The TDD phase validation implementation was complex and focused on technical implementation
2. **Documentation Debt**: Existing documentation was not updated to reflect new system capabilities
3. **User Experience Gap**: The technical implementation was complete but user guidance was missing
4. **Process Gap**: No documentation review process was included in the implementation workflow

### Impact Assessment
- **Developer Productivity**: Developers may not understand how to use the TDD phase validation system effectively
- **System Adoption**: Poor documentation reduces adoption of the enhanced prove system
- **Support Burden**: Lack of troubleshooting guidance increases support requests
- **Quality**: Developers may not follow proper TDD practices without clear guidance

## Design

### Solution Approach
Update all relevant documentation to include comprehensive guidance on TDD phases and the enhanced prove system, including:
1. TDD phase guidance in cursor-kickoff-prompt.md
2. Examples for each TDD phase
3. CLI commands for phase management
4. Troubleshooting guide for TDD validation
5. Updated workflow documentation

### Design Principles
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of TDD phase validation
- **Practical**: Include real-world examples and use cases
- **User-Friendly**: Clear, actionable guidance for developers
- **Consistent**: Align with existing documentation style and structure

## Fix Directly

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update cursor-kickoff-prompt.md**: Add comprehensive TDD phase guidance with examples
2. **Update prove-overview.md**: Document the enhanced prove system capabilities
3. **Update workflow documentation**: Include TDD phase validation in development workflow
4. **Add troubleshooting guide**: Provide solutions for common TDD validation issues
5. **Create examples**: Add practical examples for each TDD phase

### Direct Implementation
- **File Updates**: Modify existing documentation files to include TDD guidance
- **New Content**: Add new sections covering TDD phase validation
- **Examples**: Include code examples and CLI command examples
- **Troubleshooting**: Add common issues and solutions

## Implement

### Implementation Plan
1. **Update cursor-kickoff-prompt.md**: Add TDD phase guidance and examples
