# Problem Analysis: TDD Phase Documentation Updates

## Analyze
The enhanced TDD enforcement system has been implemented with comprehensive phase detection and validation capabilities, but the documentation lacks clear guidance on how developers should use these new TDD phases and validation features. This creates a knowledge gap that prevents effective adoption of the enhanced TDD system.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Documentation Gap**: Existing documentation focuses on basic prove system usage but lacks TDD phase-specific guidance
2. **Missing Examples**: No clear examples showing how to use TDD phase markers in commit messages
3. **Incomplete CLI Documentation**: New TDD phase management commands are not documented
4. **No Troubleshooting Guide**: Developers lack guidance when TDD validation fails
5. **Workflow Integration**: TDD phases are not integrated into the overall development workflow documentation

## Identify Root Cause
The root cause of the documentation gap is that the enhanced TDD system was implemented as a technical enhancement without corresponding documentation updates. The development team focused on the technical implementation (phase detection, validation, etc.) but did not update the user-facing documentation to reflect these new capabilities. This created a disconnect between what the system can do and what developers know how to use.

### Impact Assessment
- **High Impact**: Developers cannot effectively use the enhanced TDD system
- **Adoption Risk**: Poor documentation leads to low adoption rates
- **Productivity Loss**: Developers waste time figuring out TDD phase usage
- **Quality Risk**: Inconsistent TDD practices due to lack of guidance

## Fix
Update all relevant documentation files to include:
1. **Comprehensive TDD Phase Guidance**: Clear explanation of Red, Green, and Refactor phases
2. **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples for each TDD phase
3. **CLI Command Documentation**: Complete guide for TDD phase management commands
4. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
5. **Workflow Integration**: How TDD phases fit into the overall development process

### Implementation Steps
1. Create cursor-kickoff-prompt.md with TDD phase guidance
2. Update prove-overview.md with TDD phase information
3. Update .rules/00-100x-workflow.md with TDD workflow
4. Add comprehensive examples and troubleshooting guides
5. Ensure all documentation is consistent and clear

## Fix Directly
The documentation will be updated directly by:
1. **Creating new documentation files** where they don't exist (cursor-kickoff-prompt.md)
2. **Updating existing documentation files** to include TDD phase information
3. **Adding comprehensive examples** and troubleshooting guides
4. **Ensuring consistency** across all documentation files
5. **Validating changes** through the prove system

## Validate
### Success Criteria
- [ ] All documentation files updated with TDD phase guidance
- [ ] Clear examples provided for each TDD phase
- [ ] CLI commands fully documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide included
- [ ] Workflow documentation updated
- [ ] All prove checks pass

### Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity Risk**: Keep documentation concise and focused
