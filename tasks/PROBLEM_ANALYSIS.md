# Problem Analysis

## Analyze

The current authentication system lacks proper user session management and secure token handling. Users are experiencing frequent logouts and potential security vulnerabilities due to improper token storage and validation mechanisms.

## Fix

Implement a robust JWT-based authentication system with:
- Secure token storage using httpOnly cookies
- Proper token validation middleware
- Session management with refresh tokens
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Rate limiting for login attempts

## Validate

- Unit tests for authentication middleware
- Integration tests for login/logout flows
- Security audit of token handling
- Performance testing under load
- User acceptance testing for session persistence
