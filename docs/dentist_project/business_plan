Love this direction. Here’s a tightened dual-user version of the plan with #1 rewritten and the key downstream sections updated to operationalize “better experience at lower cost.”

#1 Executive Positioning (how we win)

Category: “Review Engine for Local Practices” — starting East Bay dentists.
Promise: “The happiest patients. The least work for owners. For less.”
Why we win: Because you’re a lean solo operator with near-zero overhead, you pass savings through while out-experiencing agencies and DIY tools on both sides of the interaction.

The Dual-UX Advantage

Owner (dentist/office manager): Zero-Effort
	•	2-minute activation: prefilled onboarding, instant “proof SMS,” and one-click data connect (GCal/Outlook/CSV/Front Desk Mode).
	•	No new software to learn: magic links, weekly email digest, optional dashboard later.
	•	We do it for you: concierge fallback if setup stalls; A2P + template compliance handled end-to-end.

Patient: Frictionless & delightful
	•	Single-tap review flow: no app, no login, deep-links to Google with pre-suggested copy.
	•	Respectful by default: local quiet hours, low-frequency, opt-out in one word (STOP).
	•	Brand-right & human: warm, practice-branded tone; ADA-friendly, mobile-first.

Differentiators vs. Agencies/DIY
	1.	Experience > Features
	•	Owners feel “already set up.” Patients feel “that was easy.”
	2.	Outcome > Overhead
	•	Contract-free, month-to-month; goaled on review velocity & rating.
	3.	Lean-cost operator
	•	Minimal fixed costs → price leadership without cutting quality.
	4.	Time-to-Live
	•	Checkout → live review requests in ≤48h, A2P templates approved.
	5.	Compliance & Deliverability baked-in
	•	TCPA quiet hours, STOP logic, DKIM/SPF, link-reputation tracking.

Guarantees
	•	Live in 48 hours or first month free.
	•	Beat your current vendor by 20% on cost or +10 reviews/30d or next month comped.

What changes elsewhere to lean into Dual-UX

#3 Product by Phase (updated highlights)

Phase 1 — Core Review Engine (MVP)
	•	Owner UX: prefilled onboarding, “Send me a test” first, then choose data source.
	•	Patient UX: short, friendly SMS → prefilled Google review; 48-hour gentle reminder; bilingual option (EN/ES) copy on day one.
	•	Accessibility & trust: ADA-friendly templates, practice logo lock-up, plain-language consent line in footer.

Phase 2 — Connectors & Automation
	•	Owner niceties: weekly “at-a-glance” email (reviews gained, CTR, 3 best quotes to copy into socials).
	•	Patient niceties: micro-personalization (first name, dentist name), smart send-time around visit end time.

Phase 3 — Reporting & Self-serve (lightweight)
	•	Owner: “No-login” shareable monthly PDF; optional portal for multi-location rollups.
	•	Patient: desk QR cards + NFC stickers mailed on request (no extra software).

#4 Pricing & Unit Economics (reframed for price leadership)

One simple plan to start (price-leader):
	•	Dental Review Engine — $249/mo (founder pricing; month-to-month).
Includes: SMS+email review requests, 48-hour reminder, quiet hours, click tracking, GCal/Outlook/CSV/Front Desk Mode, weekly digest, concierge onboarding.

Why this works: solo overhead + shared infra keeps COGS low; typical SMS ~$10–$30; infra amortized ~$25–$45 → 65–80% margin even at $249.

Add-ons:
	•	Extra SMS at $0.02–$0.03/SMS.
	•	Additional location +$79/mo.
	•	Optional QR mailer pack at cost + small margin (nice patient UX win).

Price-match pledge: If they show a lower comparable quote, match it and keep your guarantees.

#5 Go-to-Market (dual-UX storytelling)
	•	Owner-first messaging: “2-minute setup. No new software. Month-to-month.”
	•	Patient-experience proof: Loom shows the actual SMS → Google tap in 6 seconds; include an EN/ES split example.
	•	Sequence tweaks:
	•	Day 1 email subject: “Make reviews effortless (for you and your patients).”
	•	Day 2 SMS: “Can I text you the 6-sec review flow your patients will see?”
	•	Day 5 Loom: show their GBP, your prefilled SMS, and the one-tap link.
	•	Offer: founder pricing $249/mo for first 25 practices; no contract; “live in 48h or free.”

⸻

#7 Operations & SLAs (experience-backed)
	•	Owner SLA:
	•	Go-live ≤48h from checkout; if A2P approval lags, auto-switch to email until SMS clears.
	•	Support: same-day (biz hours), <24h for non-urgent.
	•	Patient SLA:
	•	Send within 15 minutes of visit end (or nightly batch for CSV), quiet hours enforced by practice timezone.
	•	STOP honored instantly; reminder suppressed if reviewed.

Onboarding checklist gains explicit UX checks:
	1.	Prefill success (name/phone/email/review link).
	2.	Proof SMS received by owner.
	3.	Data source connected (or Front Desk Mode issued).
	4.	Quiet hours & cap confirmed.
	5.	First 10 sends queued (dry run visible in digest).

⸻

#8 Metrics & Reviews (dual-UX KPIs)
	•	Owner experience KPIs:
	•	Onboarding completion ≤ 2 minutes (median).
	•	% practices live in ≤48h.
	•	Support touches per practice per month.
	•	Patient experience KPIs:
	•	SMS CTR ≥ 45%, opt-out < 1%, reminder lift +8–12%, EN/ES template CTR delta.
	•	Outcome KPIs:
	•	+15–30 reviews / 30 days; rating drift toward ≥4.8★; churn < 3%/mo.

Weekly ritual adds:
	•	Template A/B by tone/length (patient CTR & review completion).
	•	Onboarding drop-off heatmap (owner friction removal).
