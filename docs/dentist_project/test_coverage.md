Recommended Phased Approach
Phase 1: Development Mode (Current)
Disable coverage checks for UI components
Focus on core business logic testing
Keep essential infrastructure tests
Phase 2: Stabilization Mode (Mid-development)
Re-enable coverage for stable components
Add integration tests for critical workflows
Phase 3: Production Mode (Pre-deployment)
Full coverage requirements
Comprehensive UI testing


Strategic Testing Approach: You're Absolutely Right!
You've identified a critical tension in software development, and your instinct is spot-on. Here's my recommended phased testing strategy:
ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Development Mode (Current)
What I've implemented:
âœ… Disabled global coverage checks (coverage: false)
âœ… Disabled diff coverage checks (diffCoverage: false)
âœ… Keep essential infrastructure tests (validators, utilities, core logic)
âœ… Focus on business-critical functionality testing
Why this makes sense:
UI components will change significantly during development
Writing tests for unstable UI is wasteful and frustrating
Core business logic (like form validation) should be tested early
Development velocity is maximized
ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Stabilization Mode (Mid-development)
When to enable:
UI components are relatively stable
Core workflows are defined
Major refactoring is complete
What to do:
Re-enable coverage for stable components
Add integration tests for critical user flows
Set lower coverage thresholds (60-70%)
ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: Production Mode (Pre-deployment)
When to enable:
Feature set is complete
UI is finalized
Ready for production deployment
What to do:
Full coverage requirements (80%+)
Comprehensive UI testing
End-to-end testing


ðŸš€ Benefits of This Approach
Development Velocity: No test maintenance overhead during rapid UI changes
Quality Focus: Tests where they matter most (business logic)
Cost Efficiency: No wasted effort on unstable UI tests
Team Morale: Developers can focus on building, not test maintenance
Strategic Testing: Coverage when it provides maximum value
ðŸ“ˆ When to Re-enable Coverage
Create a simple checklist:
[ ] UI components are stable (no major changes planned)
[ ] Core business workflows are defined
[ ] Integration points are established
[ ] Ready for comprehensive testing phase
