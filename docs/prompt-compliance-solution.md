# Solving the Cursor Prompt Compliance Problem

## üö® **The Core Issue**

You've identified a fundamental problem with AI assistants like Cursor: **they don't reliably follow prompts completely**. This is not a Cursor configuration issue - it's a limitation of all current AI systems.

### **Why AI Doesn't Follow Prompts Completely:**

1. **Attention Limitations** - AI models have limited "attention" and may not process all instructions
2. **Subjective Decision Making** - AI makes its own judgments about what's "important" vs "optional"
3. **No Built-in Enforcement** - There's no mechanism to force file reading or prompt compliance
4. **Context Window Constraints** - Large prompts may exceed effective processing limits
5. **Pattern Matching Bias** - AI tends to follow familiar patterns rather than specific instructions

## üîß **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. MCP Orchestrator Enforcement (Primary Solution)**

I've integrated prompt compliance enforcement directly into the MCP Orchestrator workflow:

#### **Enhanced `claimTask` Method:**
```typescript
async claimTask(taskId: string, agent: 'cursor' | 'codex' | 'chatgpt'): Promise<void> {
  // PROMPT COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT: Check context files and architecture compliance
  console.log(`üîç Enforcing prompt compliance...`);
  await this.enforcePromptCompliance(taskId);
  console.log(`‚úÖ Prompt compliance enforcement passed`);
  
  // ... rest of claim logic
}
```

#### **New `enforcePromptCompliance` Method:**
- **Checks Required Context Files** - Verifies all mandatory files exist
- **Architecture Compliance Check** - Validates database architecture compliance
- **Database Task Detection** - Automatically detects database-related tasks
- **Violation Prevention** - Blocks tasks that violate architecture.md

### **2. Standalone Compliance Script**

Created `scripts/enforce-prompt-compliance.sh` with multiple enforcement modes:

```bash
# Check if required context files exist
npm run mcp:enforce-compliance check

# Generate context verification questions
npm run mcp:enforce-compliance generate

# Verify context understanding
npm run mcp:enforce-compliance verify

# Enforce compliance for specific task
npm run mcp:enforce-compliance enforce <task-id>
```

### **3. Context Verification Questions**

The script generates `.mcp/context-verification.md` with specific questions that prove context understanding:

```markdown
# Context Verification Questions

1. **Architecture.md**: What database should be used for core business data?
   - [ ] AWS RDS PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Supabase PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Other: ___________

2. **Architecture.md**: What should Supabase contain?
   - [ ] All core business tables
   - [ ] Only lead generation data
   - [ ] Only authentication data
   - [ ] Other: ___________
```

## üéØ **How This Solves the Problem**

### **Before (Problem):**
- Cursor could skip reading `architecture.md`
- No enforcement of prompt compliance
- Architecture violations went undetected
- Manual verification required

### **After (Solution):**
- **Automatic Enforcement** - MCP Orchestrator enforces compliance before task execution
- **File Existence Check** - Verifies all required context files exist
- **Architecture Validation** - Automatically detects architecture violations
- **Blocking Mechanism** - Prevents tasks from proceeding if compliance fails

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Automatic Enforcement (Recommended):**
```bash
# This now automatically enforces prompt compliance
npm run mcp:claim task-xyz cursor
```

### **Manual Enforcement:**
```bash
# Check compliance for specific task
npm run mcp:enforce-compliance enforce task-xyz
```

### **Context Verification:**
```bash
# Generate verification questions
npm run mcp:enforce-compliance generate

# Answer questions in .mcp/context-verification.md
# Then verify understanding
npm run mcp:enforce-compliance verify
```

## üìä **Enforcement Levels**

### **Level 1: File Existence Check**
- Verifies all required context files exist
- Blocks if any files are missing

### **Level 2: Architecture Compliance Check**
- Automatically detects database-related tasks
- Reads `architecture.md` to understand correct architecture
- Blocks tasks that violate architecture specifications

### **Level 3: Context Verification Questions**
- Generates specific questions about context understanding
- Requires manual verification of understanding
- Most thorough but requires human interaction

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Integration Points:**
1. **MCP Orchestrator** - Primary enforcement point
2. **Task Claiming** - Enforced before task execution
3. **Standalone Script** - Manual enforcement option
4. **Package.json** - Easy access via npm scripts

### **Architecture Compliance Logic:**
```typescript
private async checkArchitectureCompliance(task: Task): Promise<void> {
  // Read architecture.md to understand correct database architecture
  const architectureContent = await fs.readFile('docs/dentist_project/architecture.md', 'utf-8');
  
  // Check if task violates architecture
  if (architectureContent.includes('RDS authoritative for runtime') && 
      architectureContent.includes('Supabase (existing) - Lead-gen/outreach only')) {
    
    const taskContent = `${task.title} ${task.overview || ''} ${task.goal || ''}`.toLowerCase();
    
    // If task mentions Supabase but not lead generation, it's likely a violation
    if (taskContent.includes('supabase') && !taskContent.includes('lead') && !taskContent.includes('outreach')) {
      throw new Error(`ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION: Task appears to use Supabase for core business data. According to architecture.md, Supabase should only contain lead generation data. Core business data should be in AWS RDS.`);
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ **Benefits**

### **1. Prevents Architecture Violations**
- Automatically detects when tasks violate `architecture.md`
- Blocks execution before implementation begins
- Saves time and prevents rework

### **2. Enforces Context Reading**
- Verifies all required context files exist
- Generates verification questions to prove understanding
- Ensures comprehensive context review

### **3. Maintains Quality Standards**
- Integrates with existing MCP Orchestrator workflow
- No additional manual steps required
- Automatic enforcement at the right time

### **4. Scalable Solution**
- Works for any task type
- Easily extensible for new compliance rules
- Integrates with existing quality gates

## üö® **Limitations**

### **Current Limitations:**
1. **AI Still Makes Decisions** - Enforcement happens before AI execution, but AI can still make poor decisions during execution
2. **Manual Verification Required** - Context verification questions require human interaction
3. **Limited Architecture Detection** - Only detects obvious architecture violations
4. **File Reading Not Enforced** - Can't force AI to actually read files, only verify they exist

### **Future Improvements:**
1. **AI Execution Monitoring** - Monitor AI behavior during task execution
2. **Real-time Compliance Checking** - Check compliance during implementation
3. **Enhanced Architecture Detection** - More sophisticated violation detection
4. **Automated Context Verification** - AI-generated verification questions

## üéØ **Recommendations**

### **For Immediate Use:**
1. **Use MCP Orchestrator** - Let automatic enforcement handle compliance
2. **Review Context Questions** - Answer verification questions when generated
3. **Monitor Architecture Compliance** - Watch for architecture violation errors

### **For Future Development:**
1. **Extend Enforcement Rules** - Add more specific compliance checks
2. **Enhance Detection Logic** - Improve architecture violation detection
3. **Add Execution Monitoring** - Monitor AI behavior during task execution

## üìã **Summary**

This solution addresses the core problem by:

1. **Integrating enforcement into the workflow** - No additional steps required
2. **Automatically detecting violations** - Prevents architecture violations before they happen
3. **Providing multiple enforcement levels** - From automatic to manual verification
4. **Maintaining quality standards** - Ensures prompt compliance without breaking workflow

While we can't force AI to read files, we can enforce that the right files exist and that tasks comply with architecture specifications. This significantly reduces the risk of prompt compliance failures while maintaining the efficiency of the MCP Orchestrator workflow.
