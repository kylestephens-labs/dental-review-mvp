# Problem Analysis: ReferenceError: useFormField is not defined

## Problem Summary
The React application is failing to render due to a `ReferenceError: useFormField is not defined` error. This error occurs in the built JavaScript bundle and prevents the entire application from loading, affecting both Vitest unit tests and Playwright visual tests.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Missing Import Statement**
**Issue**: The `useFormField` hook is defined in `src/components/ui/form-hooks.ts` but is not imported in `src/components/ui/form.tsx` where it's being used.

**Evidence**:
- `useFormField` is defined in `src/components/ui/form-hooks.ts:19`
- `useFormField` is used in `src/components/ui/form.tsx` at lines 42, 50, 67, and 76
- No import statement for `useFormField` exists in `form.tsx`
- The file only imports `FormFieldContext, FormItemContext` from `./form-hooks` but not `useFormField`

### 2. **Import Statement Analysis**
**Current import in `form.tsx`**:
```typescript
import { FormFieldContext, FormItemContext, type FormFieldContextValue, type FormItemContextValue } from "./form-hooks";
```

**Missing**: `useFormField` is not included in this import statement.

### 3. **Usage Pattern Analysis**
The `useFormField` hook is used in four form components:
- `FormLabel` (line 42): `const { error, formItemId } = useFormField();`
- `FormControl` (line 50): `const { error, formItemId, formDescriptionId, formMessageId } = useFormField();`
- `FormDescription` (line 67): `const { formDescriptionId } = useFormField();`
- `FormMessage` (line 76): `const { error, formMessageId } = useFormField();`

### 4. **Build Process Impact**
- The build process completes successfully (no TypeScript errors)
- The error only manifests at runtime when the JavaScript bundle executes
- This suggests the TypeScript compiler is not catching this missing import
- The bundler (Vite) is not detecting the missing dependency

## Impact Assessment

### 1. **Application Functionality**
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: Complete application failure
- **Scope**: Entire React application fails to render
- **User Experience**: Blank page with JavaScript errors

### 2. **Testing Infrastructure**
- **Vitest Tests**: All tests fail due to React rendering errors
- **Playwright Tests**: Visual tests fail due to page not rendering
- **Test Coverage**: Cannot measure actual test coverage due to runtime errors

### 3. **Development Workflow**
- **Development**: Application may work in dev mode due to different bundling
- **Production**: Application fails completely
- **CI/CD**: All automated tests fail

## Technical Analysis

### 1. **Module Resolution**
The issue occurs because:
- `useFormField` is not exported from the module where it's defined
- The import statement doesn't include `useFormField`
- TypeScript's module resolution doesn't catch this at compile time
- Runtime module loading fails when the function is called

### 2. **Bundle Analysis**
- The build creates a 590KB JavaScript bundle
- The error occurs in the minified code at runtime
- Multiple instances of the same error suggest the function is called multiple times
- Each form component that uses `useFormField` triggers the error

### 3. **Error Propagation**
- The error cascades through the React component tree
- Form components fail to render
- IntakeForm component fails to render
- Main page fails to render
- Entire application becomes unusable

## Solution Strategy

### 1. **Immediate Fix (High Priority)**
Add `useFormField` to the import statement in `src/components/ui/form.tsx`:

```typescript
import { FormFieldContext, FormItemContext, useFormField, type FormFieldContextValue, type FormItemContextValue } from "./form-hooks";
```

### 2. **Verification Steps**
1. Fix the import statement
2. Rebuild the application
3. Test in browser to ensure rendering works
4. Run Vitest tests to verify unit tests pass
5. Run Playwright tests to verify visual tests work
6. Verify all form components render correctly

### 3. **Prevention Measures**
1. Add ESLint rules to catch missing imports
2. Add TypeScript strict mode checks
3. Implement build-time validation for missing exports
4. Add integration tests that verify form rendering

## Risk Assessment

### 1. **Low Risk**
- The fix is a simple import statement addition
- No code logic changes required
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 2. **High Impact**
- Fixing this will restore full application functionality
- All tests will start passing
- Development workflow will be restored
- Production deployment will work correctly

## Dependencies

### 1. **Direct Dependencies**
- `react-hook-form` - Required for form context
- `@radix-ui/react-label` - Required for form components
- `@radix-ui/react-slot` - Required for form control

### 2. **Indirect Dependencies**
- All components using form elements depend on this fix
- IntakeForm component is the primary consumer
- Any future form components will depend on this fix

## Testing Strategy

### 1. **Unit Tests**
- Test each form component individually
- Verify `useFormField` hook works correctly
- Test form validation and error handling

### 2. **Integration Tests**
- Test complete form submission flow
- Verify form components render correctly
- Test form interactions and state management

### 3. **Visual Tests**
- Use Playwright to verify form rendering
- Test form interactions and validation
- Verify responsive design works correctly

## Conclusion

This is a critical but easily fixable issue. The missing import statement for `useFormField` is preventing the entire application from rendering. The fix is straightforward and low-risk, but the impact is significant as it affects all application functionality and testing infrastructure.

**Priority**: Critical - Fix immediately
**Effort**: Low - Single line change
**Impact**: High - Restores full application functionality
