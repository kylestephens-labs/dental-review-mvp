# Prove Quality Gates T16-T19b Implementation and GitHub Automation - 2025-01-18

## Overview
This session focused on implementing the final quality gates for the Prove system (T16-T19b) and adding comprehensive GitHub Actions automation for issue management. The implementation revealed critical insights about test infrastructure, coverage analysis, diff coverage calculation, and the importance of automated issue lifecycle management in CI/CD workflows.

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Test Infrastructure and Coverage Artifact Generation**
- **Problem**: T17 required coverage artifacts but Vitest wasn't configured to generate them
- **Solution**: Updated `vitest.config.ts` to include coverage settings with `@vitest/coverage-v8` provider
- **Learning**: Test frameworks need explicit configuration for coverage generation - it's not automatic
- **Pattern**: Always verify that required artifacts are actually generated by the configured tools
- **Critical**: Coverage artifacts are essential for diff coverage analysis and quality gates

### 2. **Istanbul Coverage Format and Global Coverage Calculation**
- **Discovery**: Coverage files use raw Istanbul format (per-file data) not summary format
- **Challenge**: Had to implement custom parsing logic to calculate global coverage metrics
- **Solution**: Created `CoverageAnalyzer.parseIstanbulCoverage()` to aggregate statement, branch, function, and line coverage
- **Learning**: Coverage tools often use complex internal formats - don't assume simple summary files
- **Pattern**: Build robust parsers for external tool outputs rather than expecting simple formats

### 3. **Path Normalization in Coverage Analysis**
- **Problem**: Git diff returns relative paths but Istanbul coverage uses absolute paths
- **Impact**: Coverage lookups always failed, resulting in 100% diff coverage (false positive)
- **Solution**: Implemented path normalization using `path.resolve()` and fallback matching
- **Learning**: Path handling is critical in cross-platform environments - always normalize paths
- **Pattern**: Use proper path utilities (`path.resolve`, `path.normalize`) for cross-platform compatibility

### 4. **Mode-Aware Quality Gate Enforcement**
- **Implementation**: T18 and T19b required different behavior for functional vs non-functional tasks
- **Pattern**: Use `context.mode` to conditionally enforce rules based on task type
- **Learning**: Quality gates should be context-aware, not one-size-fits-all
- **Benefit**: Prevents false positives for non-functional tasks while enforcing strict rules for functional tasks

### 5. **TDD Enforcement and Glob Pattern Matching**
- **Implementation**: T18 uses `minimatch` to categorize changed files into source vs test patterns
- **Pattern**: Use established glob matching libraries rather than custom regex patterns
- **Learning**: File categorization is essential for TDD enforcement - need reliable pattern matching
- **Integration**: Works with existing `srcGlobs` and `testGlobs` configuration

### 6. **Diff Coverage Calculation and Line-Level Analysis**
- **Challenge**: Calculate coverage specifically for changed lines, not entire files
- **Implementation**: Parse git diff output to extract changed lines, then check coverage for each line
- **Learning**: Line-level analysis requires understanding both git diff format and coverage data structure
- **Pattern**: Build comprehensive utilities that handle edge cases (missing coverage, path mismatches)

### 7. **GitHub Actions Workflow Automation**
- **Problem**: Urgent rollback issues were created automatically but never closed
- **Solution**: Added auto-close functionality to both `prove-fast.yml` and `prove-nightly.yml`
- **Learning**: CI/CD automation should handle complete issue lifecycles, not just creation
- **Pattern**: Always consider the full lifecycle of automated resources

### 8. **YAML Syntax and GitHub Actions Scripts**
- **Problem**: JavaScript template literals in YAML caused parsing errors
- **Solution**: Used YAML multiline string syntax (`|`) instead of backticks
- **Learning**: GitHub Actions scripts must use proper YAML syntax, not JavaScript syntax
- **Pattern**: Use YAML-native string formatting for GitHub Actions scripts

### 9. **Codex Review Process and Critical Bug Detection**
- **Process**: External review caught multiple critical bugs in diff coverage implementation
- **Bugs Found**: Path normalization, line coverage calculation, cross-platform path handling
- **Learning**: External review is essential for catching subtle but critical bugs
- **Pattern**: Address external feedback immediately and thoroughly test fixes

### 10. **Git Workflow and Branch Management**
- **Problem**: Created unnecessary PR instead of merging directly to main
- **Learning**: Understand user intent - "push to GitHub" doesn't always mean "create PR"
- **Pattern**: Clarify workflow preferences before executing git operations
- **Follow-up**: Properly merge feature branches and clean up remote branches

## Technical Implementation Patterns

### 1. **Coverage Analysis Pattern**
```typescript
export class CoverageAnalyzer {
  static parseIstanbulCoverage(data: Record<string, CoverageFile>): CoverageSummary {
    // Aggregate coverage data from all files
    // Calculate percentages for statements, branches, functions, lines
    // Return comprehensive summary
  }
  
  static calculateChangedLinesCoverage(
    changedLines: ChangedLine[],
    coverageData: Record<string, CoverageFile>,
    workingDirectory: string
  ): CoverageResult {
    // Normalize paths for cross-platform compatibility
    // Check coverage for each changed line
    // Return detailed results with uncovered lines
  }
}
```

### 2. **Mode-Aware Enforcement Pattern**
```typescript
export async function checkTddChangedHasTests(context: ProveContext): Promise<CheckResult> {
  // Only enforce for functional tasks
  if (context.mode !== 'functional') {
    return { ok: true, reason: 'TDD check only applies to functional tasks' };
  }
  
  // Check if source files changed without test files
  // Use minimatch for reliable glob pattern matching
}
```

### 3. **GitHub Actions Auto-Close Pattern**
```yaml
- name: Auto-Close Urgent Issues on Success
  if: success() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      // Find open urgent issues
      // Close each with detailed resolution comment
      // Handle errors gracefully
```

### 4. **Path Normalization Pattern**
```typescript
// Normalize paths for cross-platform compatibility
const normalizedPath = normalize(resolve(workingDirectory, filePath));

// Try multiple path matching strategies
let coverage = coverageData[normalizedPath];
if (!coverage) {
  coverage = coverageData[filePath]; // Fallback to relative
}
if (!coverage) {
  // Try partial matching
  const matchingKey = Object.keys(coverageData).find(key => 
    normalize(key).endsWith(normalize(filePath))
  );
}
```

## Quality Gates Architecture

### **T16 - Test Execution (tests.ts)**
- **Purpose**: Run unit/integration tests with coverage
- **Implementation**: Executes `npm run test -- --coverage`
- **Integration**: Basic checks sequence, fail-fast behavior
- **Dependencies**: Vitest test runner with coverage provider

### **T17 - Coverage Artifact Generation**
- **Purpose**: Ensure coverage data is available for analysis
- **Implementation**: Configured Vitest to output JSON coverage reports
- **Artifact**: `coverage/coverage-final.json` in Istanbul format
- **Integration**: Required for T17a and T19

### **T17a - Global Coverage Check (coverage.ts)**
- **Purpose**: Enforce minimum global coverage threshold
- **Implementation**: Parse Istanbul coverage and calculate global metrics
- **Threshold**: Configurable via `globalCoverage` setting
- **Toggle**: Respects `toggles.coverage` setting

### **T18 - TDD Enforcement (tddChangedHasTests.ts)**
- **Purpose**: Ensure functional tasks include test changes
- **Implementation**: Use minimatch to categorize changed files
- **Mode-Aware**: Only enforces for functional tasks
- **Patterns**: Uses `srcGlobs` and `testGlobs` configuration

### **T19 - Diff Coverage Check (diffCoverage.ts)**
- **Purpose**: Enforce coverage threshold on changed lines
- **Implementation**: Parse git diff and check line-level coverage
- **Threshold**: Configurable via `diffCoverageFunctional` setting
- **Mode-Aware**: Only enforces for functional tasks

### **T19b - Mode-Aware Diff Coverage**
- **Purpose**: Conditional enforcement based on task mode
- **Implementation**: Skip diff coverage for non-functional tasks
- **Pattern**: Use `context.mode` for conditional behavior

## GitHub Actions Automation

### **Auto-Close Functionality**
- **Trigger**: When prove quality gates pass successfully
- **Scope**: Closes issues with `urgent`, `rollback`, `main-branch`, `prove-failure` labels
