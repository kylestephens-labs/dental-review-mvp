## Overview
This session focused on implementing comprehensive performance optimizations and error handling improvements for the feature flag system through 4 major refactoring tasks. The work involved creating intelligent caching systems, performance monitoring, pattern compilation optimization, and centralized error handling to significantly improve system performance and reliability.

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Performance Monitoring and Telemetry Architecture**

- **Impact**: Enabled detection of performance regressions and established performance baselines
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Tracks duration, memory usage, operations count, cache hits/misses
  - Implements regression detection against historical baselines
  - Provides structured logging for both human and machine consumption

### 2. **Pattern Compilation Caching Strategy**

  - Memory usage tracking and cleanup automation

### 3. **Intelligent Flag Registry Caching**
- **Problem**: Flag registry loaded all flags on every check, causing redundant I/O operations

- **Impact**: Implemented 9 error types with automatic recovery strategies
- **Technical Details**:
  - Error categorization: Detection, Registry, Validation, FileRead, etc.
  - Severity levels: Low, Medium, High, Critical
  - Recovery strategies and error statistics tracking

### 5. **Commit Message Convention Validation**
- **Problem**: Commit message format didn't follow required convention, causing CI failures

- **Learning**: CI/CD systems require strict adherence to commit message conventions
- **Pattern**: Always validate commit message format before pushing
- **Impact**: Resolved GitHub Actions failures and established proper commit message discipline
- **Technical Details**:
  - Regex pattern: `/^(feat|fix|chore|refactor|revert|test):\s+(.+?)\s+\[T-(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d+)\]\s+\[MODE:(F|NF)\]$/`
  - Validates task ID format and mode specification
