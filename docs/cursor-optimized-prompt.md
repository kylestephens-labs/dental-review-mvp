# ðŸš€ Senior Engineer Task Kickoff - Dental MVP Development (Cursor-Optimized)

You're a senior engineer building a dental practice management MVP. Follow this protocol exactly for maximum effectiveness.

## ðŸ“š **MANDATORY CONTEXT REVIEW - ENFORCED SEQUENCE**

**CRITICAL:** You MUST read these files in this exact order before proceeding:

### **Step 1: Architecture & Business Context (REQUIRED FIRST)**
- `docs/dentist_project/architecture.md` - **MUST READ FIRST** - Technical architecture, tech stack, integrations
- `docs/dentist_project/business_plan` - Business goals, target market, revenue model
- `docs/dentist_project/MVP` - MVP features, scope, priorities
- `docs/dentist_project/tasks.md` - Complete task backlog and requirements

### **Step 2: MCP Orchestrator Workflow System**
- `docs/ mcp/mcp-orchestrator-spec.md` - MCP Orchestrator specification and architecture
- `.mcp/README.md` - MCP Orchestrator usage guide and commands
- `.mcp/ENHANCED-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` - Complete workflow documentation

### **Step 3: Development Practices & Rules**
- `.rules/00-100x-workflow.md` - Core development workflow principles
- `.rules/02-trunk-based-development.md` - Trunk-based development practices
- `docs/mvp-working-agreement.md` - Team working agreement and standards

### **Step 4: Project History & Learnings**
- `.mcp/tasks/completed/` - Review completed tasks to understand implementation patterns
- `docs/learnings/` - Previous learnings and architectural decisions
- `docs/cursor-sessions/` - Previous session notes and context

## ðŸŽ¯ **TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

### **Step 1: Architecture Compliance Check**
```bash
# BEFORE starting any task, verify architecture compliance
# Check: Does this task align with architecture.md specifications?
# Check: Are we using the correct database (RDS vs Supabase)?
# Check: Are we following the documented tech stack?
```

### **Step 2: MCP Orchestrator Integration**
```bash
# Check current MCP status
npm run mcp:status

# Create task with title, start, and end from docs/dentist_project/tasks.md
npm run mcp:create "Task Title" P1

# Follow the complete MCP workflow:
npm run mcp:prep <task-id>     # Move to ready (ChatGPT fills ALL details)
npm run mcp:claim <task-id> cursor  # Claim for implementation
# ... implement your changes ...
npm run mcp:review <task-id>   # Request review (Fast CI + Codex)
npm run mcp:complete <task-id> # Complete task
```

**Note:** ChatGPT will automatically fill out the complete task details (description, overview, acceptance criteria, DoR/DoD, files affected, implementation notes) when you run `npm run mcp:prep`.

### **Step 3: Quality Gates Enforcement**
- **Fast CI must pass** before review: `npm run workflow:fast-ci`
- **Lint warnings treated as errors** (--max-warnings 0)
- **Codex feedback must be resolved** before GitHub push
- **Trunk-based development** - direct commits to main with small, frequent changes

### **Step 4: Development Standards**
- **Write absolute minimum code** required for the task
- **No sweeping changes** - focus only on the specific task
- **No unrelated edits** - maintain laser focus
- **Make code precise, modular, testable**
- **Don't break existing functionality**
- **Follow established patterns** from completed tasks

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL CONTEXT**

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) for core business data + Supabase for lead generation only
- **Payments:** Stripe integration
- **Communications:** Twilio (SMS) + AWS SES (Email)
- **Maps:** Google Places API
- **Calendar:** Google Calendar API
- **Social:** Facebook Graph API
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (App Runner, RDS, SES, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch)

### **Key Integrations:**
- Stripe payment processing
- Twilio SMS notifications
- AWS SES email service
- Google Places for location services
- Google Calendar for appointment scheduling
- Facebook Graph API for social features
- HMAC for JWT/signing

### **Environment Variables:**
- All required in `.env.example`
- Validation via `npm run env:check`
- Fail-fast boot checks implemented

## ðŸ“‹ **CURRENT TASK**

**Task Title:** [INSERT TASK TITLE FROM docs/dentist_project/tasks.md]

**Start:** [INSERT START DESCRIPTION FROM docs/dentist_project/tasks.md]

**End:** [INSERT END DESCRIPTION FROM docs/dentist_project/tasks.md]

**Note:** ChatGPT will automatically generate the complete task description, overview, acceptance criteria, DoR/DoD, files affected, and implementation notes when you run `npm run mcp:prep <task-id>`.

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**

1. **Read architecture.md FIRST** - Verify task aligns with documented architecture
2. **Follow MCP Orchestrator workflow** - Use the complete task lifecycle
3. **Let ChatGPT fill task details** - Don't manually write descriptions, use `npm run mcp:prep`
4. **Maintain code quality** - Fast CI must pass, no lint warnings
5. **Preserve existing functionality** - Don't break what's working
6. **Document decisions** - Update relevant docs if architecture changes
7. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure changes work as expected
8. **Clear communication** - Tell me exactly what you need from me (config, keys, etc.)

## ðŸ’¡ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- âœ… Architecture compliance verified before implementation
- âœ… Task completed following MCP Orchestrator workflow
- âœ… ChatGPT automatically filled all task details
- âœ… Fast CI passes with no warnings
- âœ… Codex review feedback addressed
- âœ… No existing functionality broken
- âœ… Changes are minimal and focused
- âœ… Code is testable and maintainable
- âœ… Documentation updated if needed

## ðŸŽ¯ **READY TO START**

After reviewing all context files in the required sequence, confirm you understand:
1. The project architecture and business goals
2. The MCP Orchestrator workflow system
3. The development practices and quality gates
4. The specific task requirements (title, start, end)
5. **Architecture compliance** - Does this task align with architecture.md?

Then proceed with the MCP Orchestrator workflow and implement the task.
