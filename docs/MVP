Got it — I applied your Fit Check + Gaps + Optimization to the MVP. Here’s the updated, dual-UX–tightened MVP (only what changed or needs to be precise is modified; everything else remains as-is).

⸻

🧠 Vision (unchanged)

Become the “Review Engine for East Bay Dentists” — help every local practice reach 4.8★+ with zero staff effort by automating post-visit review requests.

⸻

🎯 Goal (90 days) — updated for founder pricing
	•	15–25 paying practices × $249 MRR = $3.7k–$6.2k MRR.
	•	< 48 h from checkout → live reviews sending.
	•	< 45 min daily ops.

⸻

⚙️ Ruthless MVP Build Plan (Phase + Priority) — key moves: STOP + EN/ES + ADA + instrumentation into Phase 1; weekly digest v1 pulls forward

PHASE 1 — Core Loop / “Can we send a review request?” (strengthened)

Priority	Item	Status / Notes
1	🧩 Repurpose landing → Stripe checkout	SKU at $249; checkout.session webhook → create practice row + defaults (guarantees metadata).
2	🔴 n8n Flow C – Onboarding	Stripe webhook → create practice + welcome email + magic-link onboarding.
3	🧩 Onboarding portal (Next.js)	Prefill practice name/email/phone; Places API review link. Add instrumentation: write onboarding_started_at, onboarding_completed_at, proof_sms_sent event rows for SLA tracking.
4	🔴 Twilio + A2P registration	Set up SMS sender, register brand/campaign. Include template library: EN/ES variants, ADA-checked microcopy, practice logo lock-up.
5	🔴 Send Test SMS (Proof of Life)	Button → n8n → Twilio SendMessage → owner; log success/failure events.
6	🧩 Quiet hours + daily caps defaults	Settings columns + enforcement.
7	🔴 STOP/opt-out handling (moved from P2)	n8n function node + Twilio webhook to capture STOP/UNSUB; immediate suppression + event audit.
8	🔴 GBP review link resolver	Places API → store google_review_link per practice.
9	🔴 Data model extensions	Add patients, visits, review_requests, settings, events (+ unique indices). Events table powers KPI instrumentation.
10	🔴 n8n Flow A – Fulfillment	Webhook → Normalize → Throttle → Send SMS/Email (EN/ES) → 48 h reminder (suppressed if reviewed/STOP).
11	🔴 Click tracking redirect	Log clicked_at in events → forward to Google review URL.
12	🔴 Weekly Digest v1 (pulled into P1)	SES template: sent/CTR/reviews added + top 3 quotes. Uses events aggregates.

✅ Output of Phase 1: First practice can pay (at $249), complete a 2-minute onboarding, receive proof SMS, connect calendar/CSV or use Front Desk Mode (if available), start sending review asks with quiet hours + STOP from the very first send, receive weekly digest v1.

⸻

PHASE 2 — Data Connectors & Automation (unchanged scope minus moved items)

Priority	Item	Status / Notes
1	🔴 Google Calendar OAuth connect	n8n Google Calendar → Watch Events → enqueue review asks.
2	🔴 Outlook Calendar OAuth connect	n8n Microsoft Graph → Watch Events.
3	🧩 CSV upload	Reuse upload code → patients.csv import.
4	🔴 Front Desk Mode	Tiny form (name + mobile/email) → n8n webhook → send SMS; per-practice token.
5	🔴 Reminder + STOP handling	(moved to Phase 1).
6	🧩 Weekly Digest Email v2	Expand metrics (peer deltas, template A/B), but v1 already live.

✅ Output of Phase 2: Fully hands-off engine running for 1–2 pilots with connectors and manual fallback.

⸻

PHASE 3 — Sales Machine & Reporting (unchanged)

Priority	Item	Notes
1	🧩 Outreach engine update	Dentist ICP + “try the demo” links showing patient flow.
2	🔴 Demo microsite	Shows current rating + leaderboard + “text me demo.”
3	🔴 Benchmark email cron	Monthly peer velocity report.
4	🧩 Decision Pack update	Review engine metrics + lead responses.
5	🔴 Stripe Customer Portal link	Self-serve upgrade/cancel.

Notes on the changes (why this works)
	•	Promise kept from day one: Quiet hours + STOP in Phase 1 ensures “respectful by default” from first send.
	•	Patient-first polish early: EN/ES + ADA-checked microcopy + brand lock-up make the SMS feel warm, human, and accessible.
	•	Measure what we guarantee: Events instrumentation enables onboarding time, CTR, opt-out, reminder effectiveness, and digest aggregation — powering your weekly ritual and guarantees.
	•	Positioning consistency: Stripe SKU and copy aligned to $249 founder pricing and cost leadership narrative.
	•	Experience cadence: Shipping digest v1 in Week 1 gives owners visible value immediately, while v2 detail lands in Phase 2.

If you want, I can now generate the exact Phase 1 build spec (DB schema for events, settings, review_requests; n8n node graph with STOP webhook; Twilio/A2P template set EN/ES; onboarding API endpoints; digest v1 SQL) to drop straight into implementation.
