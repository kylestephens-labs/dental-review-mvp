# Verify Prove System Functionality After Fixes

## Overview of the task
After all individual fixes are completed, verify that the prove system is fully functional and all quality gates are working properly. This is a comprehensive validation task to ensure the prove system can be re-enabled without bypassing checks.

### Files & Resources
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `tools/prove/runner.ts` - Verify all checks are enabled
  - `tools/prove/checks/*.ts` - Verify all check functions work
  - `prove-report.json` - Verify report generation
  - `package.json` - Verify prove scripts work
  - All test files - Verify tests pass
  - All TypeScript files - Verify compilation passes
- **Dependencies**: All previous fix tasks must be completed first
- **External Resources**: 
  - [Prove System Documentation](docs/misc/prove_enforcement_8_paths/prove-overview.md)
  - [Quality Gates Architecture](docs/misc/prove_enforcement_8_paths/architecture.md)

#### - **Success**: 
- `npm run prove` passes without any failures
- `npm run prove:quick` passes without any failures
- All TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- All tests pass (`npm test`)
- Coverage generation works (`npm run test -- --coverage`)
- Environment validation works (`npm run env:check`)
- Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- Prove report is generated successfully
- No `--no-verify` flags needed for git operations
- CI/CD pipeline can run prove checks without bypassing

##### Anything else relevant a future cursor chat needs to know to be successful with delivering the given task
- This is a validation task that should be run after all other fixes are complete
- Test both `npm run prove` and `npm run prove:quick` to ensure both modes work
- Verify that the prove system can be used in CI/CD without bypassing checks
- Check that all quality gates are properly enforced
- Ensure that the prove system provides meaningful feedback when checks fail
- Verify that the prove report contains accurate information
- Test that the prove system works with both functional and non-functional task modes
- This task validates that the entire prove system is working as designed
