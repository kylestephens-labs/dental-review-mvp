## **üéØ Quick Start Guide**

### **For Developers**
1. Read [tdd-implementation-tasks.md](./tdd-implementation-tasks.md) for task details
2. Review [tdd-architecture.md](./tdd-architecture.md) for technical understanding
3. Check [tdd-codex-feedback.md](./tdd-codex-feedback.md) for context on improvements

### **For Project Managers**

## **üîß Configuration Reference**

### **TDD Configuration Schema**
```typescript
interface TddConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  requirePhaseMarkers: boolean;
  phases: {
    red: {
      requireTestFirst: boolean;
      requireTestQuality: boolean;
      minTestCoverage: number;
    };
    green: {
      requireTestsPass: boolean;
      requireImplementationValidation: boolean;
      minCoverageThreshold: number;
    };
    refactor: {
      requireQualityImprovement: boolean;
      requireBehaviorPreservation: boolean;
      qualityMetrics: string[];
    };
  };
}
```

### **CLI Commands**
```bash
# TDD phase management
npm run tdd:red      # Mark current work as Red phase
npm run tdd:green    # Mark current work as Green phase
npm run tdd:refactor # Mark current work as Refactor phase

# Enhanced prove commands
npm run prove:tdd    # Run prove with TDD phase detection
npm run prove:phase=red  # Run prove expecting Red phase
```
