# ðŸ“‹ **TDD Enhancement Implementation Tasks**

## **Task Overview**

This document provides detailed implementation tasks for the Enhanced TDD Enforcement system, broken down into small, testable units with clear acceptance criteria.

---

## **Task 1: Update Commit Message Convention Documentation**

### **Overview**
Update the cursor-kickoff-prompt.md to include TDD phase markers in the commit message convention and provide clear examples.

### **Goal**
Ensure developers know how to use TDD phase markers in their commit messages so the enhanced TDD checks can properly detect phases.

### **BDD Scenario**
```
Feature: TDD Phase Marker Documentation
  As a developer
  I want to know how to mark my commits with TDD phases
  So that the prove system can validate my TDD process

  Scenario: Developer commits with TDD phase
    Given I am working on a functional task
    When I commit my changes
    Then I should include the appropriate TDD phase marker
```

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Update commit message format to include `[TDD:(red|green|refactor)]` marker
- [ ] Add clear examples for each TDD phase
- [ ] Update the commit message validation regex
- [ ] Add guidance on when to use each phase marker

### **Files & Resources**
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `docs/prove.md/prove_enforcement_8_paths/cursor-kickoff-prompt.md`
  - `tools/prove/checks/commit-msg-convention.ts`
- **Dependencies**: None
- **External Resources**: None

### **Business Context**
- **Value**: Enables proper TDD phase detection and validation
- **Risk**: Developers might not follow the new format initially
- **Success**: All commit messages include proper TDD phase markers when appropriate

## **Task 2: Fix Diff-Coverage Configuration Alignment**

### **Overview**
Align the diff-coverage configuration with the documentation promises to eliminate confusion about whether 85% coverage is required.

### **Goal**
Ensure the configuration matches the documentation so developers know exactly what coverage thresholds they need to meet.

### **BDD Scenario**
```
Feature: Diff-Coverage Configuration Alignment
  As a developer
  I want the configuration to match the documentation
  So that I know exactly what coverage thresholds are enforced

  Scenario: Developer checks coverage requirements
    Given I am working on a functional task
    When I check the prove configuration
    Then the diff-coverage toggle should be enabled and match the documented 85% threshold
```

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Enable diff-coverage toggle in default configuration
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the actual configuration
- [ ] Add clear explanation of when diff-coverage is enforced
- [ ] Update configuration validation to ensure consistency

  - `tools/prove/prove.config.ts`
  - `docs/prove.md/prove_enforcement_8_paths/cursor-kickoff-prompt.md`
- **Dependencies**: None
- **External Resources**: None

### **Business Context**
- **Value**: Eliminates confusion about coverage requirements
- **Risk**: Might increase build failures if coverage is too strict
- **Success**: Configuration and documentation are perfectly aligned
