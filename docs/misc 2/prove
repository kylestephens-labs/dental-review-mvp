Awesome—let’s turn your 8 practices into a single, robust gating system that any IDE/agent must pass. I’ll keep this opinionated, Node/TS-first, and tailored to your stack.

The shape of a solid gating system

Think in layers:
	1.	Local gates (fast): hooks that run in <10s to prevent bad commits.
	2.	CI gates (authoritative): reproducible checks on clean runners.
	3.	Preview gates (integration): hit real services/sandboxes in ephemeral envs.
	4.	Release gates (prod safety): deploy only if health + migrations + canary pass.

Everything funnels through one command: npm run prove.

Your 8 practices → concrete, enforceable gates

0) Single “prove” script (the contract)

package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit",
    "lint": "eslint . --max-warnings=0",
    "unit": "vitest run --reporter=verbose",
    "e2e:web": "playwright test --project=chromium",
    "bundle:size": "size-limit",
    "diffcov": "diff-cover coverage/coverage-final.json --fail-under=85",
    "env:check": "tsx scripts/validate-env.ts",
    "migrate:check": "prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --script > /dev/null",
    "build:web": "vite build",
    "build:server": "tsup src/server/index.ts --format cjs --dts",
    "prove": "npm run env:check && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run unit && npm run e2e:web && npm run bundle:size && npm run diffcov && npm run build:web && npm run build:server"
  }
}

	•	You only ever ask the agent to: “run npm run prove and paste the full log.”

⸻

1) TDD Enforcement (Red→Green→Refactor)
	•	Rule: PRs must show at least one failing test first commit, then the fix.
	•	CI check: diff-cover on changed lines (≥85%) + forbid PRs with 0 test files changed when code changed.
	•	Prompt macro: “Add a failing test that expresses the goal, run tests, paste failing output. I will then write ‘APPROVE: implement’.”

2) Trunk-Based Development (main-only)
	•	Use short-lived PRs to main only with branch protection (required checks = your CI jobs).
	•	Disallow direct pushes, require PRs (even as solo). This still counts as trunk-based but adds auditability.

3) Pre-Conflict Gate (no merge conflicts)
	•	GitHub branch protection: Require branch to be up to date before merging.

4) Environment Variables (valid config)
	•	At startup and in CI, validate with Zod/Envalid and fail fast.
/scripts/validate-env.ts

import { z } from "zod";
const Env = z.object({
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(["development","test","production"]),
  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: z.string().min(1),
  TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: z.string().min(1),
  TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: z.string().min(1),
  GOOGLE_API_KEY: z.string().min(1),
  GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID: z.string().min(1),
  GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET: z.string().min(1),
  AWS_REGION: z.string().min(1),
  // …add SES, App Runner URLs, SUPABASE_* as needed
});
Env.parse(process.env);
console.log("env ok");

	•	Keep a synced .env.example; CI loads sandbox/test keys.

5) Type Safety (TypeScript strict)
	•	tsconfig.json with "strict": true, "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true.
	•	CI runs npm run typecheck and blocks on any error.

6) Code Quality (Linting)
	•	ESLint with TypeScript, React, a11y, and security rules (eslint-plugin-security, jsx-a11y).
	•	--max-warnings=0 turns warnings into fails.

7) Test Suite (unit + e2e)
	•	Unit with Vitest.
	•	E2E (Playwright) on ephemeral preview hitting your backend.
	•	Diff coverage on changed lines via diff-cover to ensure new code is tested.

8) Build Verification
	•	Build frontend (vite build) and server (tsup or tsc) in CI.
	•	Fail if production build emits type errors, circular deps (optionally check with madge).

High-value additions (worth it for solo founders)

A) Pre-commit & pre-push hooks
	•	Husky + lint-staged: run eslint --fix, prettier --write, and tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit on staged files quickly.
	•	Pre-push: run npm run unit only (fast) to avoid pushing red code.

B) Secrets & license gating
	•	gitleaks pre-commit to prevent secrets in git.
	•	License/compliance gate (license-checker) to block forbidden licenses in deps.

C) Bundle-size & performance
	•	size-limit with budgets for your Vite bundles (e.g., <170KB gz).
	•	Lighthouse CI on preview URL to set a performance+accessibility floor (e.g., PWA, a11y ≥ 85).

D) Dependency health
	•	Renovate (or Dependabot) with CI auto-tests.
	•	npm audit (or better, pnpm audit + oss-review-toolkit if you want depth).

E) API & third-party integrations gates (your stack!)
	•	Stripe: run in test mode with stripe-cli to trigger webhooks in CI (stripe listen → your preview endpoint).
	•	Twilio: use Twilio test credentials and magic phone numbers; assert no real SMS are sent.
	•	SES: use AWS sesv2 sandbox or local mock (e.g., wiremock/testcontainers) and assert requests made.
	•	Google Places/Calendar: wrap fetchers; in tests use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to simulate responses. Keep 1–2 live smoke tests in preview against quota-friendly endpoints.
	•	Facebook Graph: mostly mock in CI; keep a nightly canary call in staging to catch auth/permission drifts.

Rule of thumb: CI uses mocks/sandboxes, preview/staging runs a tiny real canary (1 request) per integration.

F) Database safety & migrations
	•	Use Prisma or your tool of choice.
	•	CI step: spin Postgres via Testcontainers, run prisma migrate deploy, then npm run unit:e2e-db.
	•	Detect destructive migrations: require a label like needs-approval if DROP/ALTER DROP is found.
	•	Seed minimal data and run contract tests (e.g., “create lead → appears in RDS, mirrored in Supabase as lead gen event”).

G) Observability gates
	•	Add a /healthz and /readyz endpoint.
	•	Preview deployment waits until both return 200 for 30s straight before running e2e.
	•	Emit OpenTelemetry traces in preview; CI can assert at least N traces for the e2e flow.

H) A11y and i18n basics
	•	Add jest-axe (or Playwright a11y checks) for key pages; fail on violations.
	•	Even if you’re not localizing, an a11y floor is high-value and cheap.

I) Security lint for server
	•	eslint-plugin-security, ts-safeql (if using raw SQL), or Prisma “unsafe query” checks.
	•	Basic Zod validation at all API boundaries; refuse unvalidated input.

Minimal GitHub Actions (drop-in)

.github/workflows/ci.yml

name: CI
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20, cache: 'npm' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run prove

  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: verify
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20, cache: 'npm' }
      - run: npm ci
      # Spin ephemeral services
      - name: Start Postgres
        uses: docker/actions-runner@v2 # (or testcontainers via node)
      - name: Seed & migrate
        run: npm run migrate:check && npx prisma migrate deploy && node scripts/seed.js
      - name: Start server & web
        run: |
          node dist/server/index.js & # or docker-compose up -d
          npx vite preview --port 5173 &
          npx wait-on http://localhost:3000/healthz http://localhost:5173
      - name: E2E against preview
        run: npm run e2e:web

Branch protection (GitHub):
	•	Require status checks: CI / verify, CI / preview.
	•	Require up-to-date branch.
	•	Require PRs to main.

Local hooks (Husky)

.husky/pre-commit

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
npx lint-staged
npm run typecheck

.husky/pre-push

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
npm run unit

lint-staged.config.mjs

export default {
  "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"]
}


⸻

Frontend-specific gates (Vite/React/Tailwind/Shadcn)
	•	size-limit budgets per entry: app <170KB gz, vendor <250KB gz.
	•	Playwright scenarios: first paint, auth flow, Stripe checkout test mode.
	•	axe-core scan via Playwright for key routes.

⸻

Backend-specific gates (App Runner / RDS / SES / Twilio)
	•	Health/readiness required before e2e.
	•	Contract tests for public API routes using Zod/OpenAPI; run in CI.
	•	Testcontainers to bring up Postgres for integration tests.
	•	SES/Twilio adapters with “no-op in test” + record calls; assert on “outbox”.

Why CL and github?

Great question. Short answer: you keep one source of truth for the checks (the prove script), and you use it in two places for two different jobs:

Why have both?
	1.	Speed vs. Enforcement

	•	Local npm run prove = fast feedback. You (or your agentic IDE) can iterate in minutes without burning CI minutes or opening PRs.
	•	GitHub Actions = independent enforcement. It runs the same npm run prove in a clean machine and blocks merges. Local can be skipped or misconfigured; CI can’t (with branch protection).

	2.	“Works on my machine” vs. Clean Room

	•	Local runs on your laptop (cached deps, odd env vars, Node 20.11.1).
	•	CI runs on a fresh, reproducible environment (exact Node, exact browsers, no stray secrets). This catches “it only passed locally” bugs.

	3.	Trust & Auditability

	•	Local is for convenience; its results aren’t a record.
	•	CI gives immutable logs, artifacts, and a green check that protects main. That’s what turns agent claims into mergeable truth.

	4.	DRY, not duplicate logic

	•	You don’t maintain two systems. You maintain one prove command; GitHub Actions just calls it.
	•	If you change a gate (add diff-coverage, size budgets, etc.), you change it once in package.json, and both local and CI get it.

	5.	Different lifecycles

	•	Pre-commit / local catches quick mistakes before they leave your machine.
	•	CI on PR validates in isolation, can run matrix (Node 18/20, Linux/macOS), and can do post-deploy smoke tests.

Minimal pattern

package.json — single source of truth:

{
  "scripts": {
    "prove": "npm run env:check && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run coverage && npm run diffcov && npm run build && npm run size && npm run openapi:check"
  }
}

.github/workflows/prove.yml — thin wrapper that enforces it:

name: Prove
on: { pull_request: { branches: [ main ] } }
jobs:
  prove:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20, cache: 'npm' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run prove   # exact same command

What if I picked only one?
	•	Only local: fast, but not enforceable. An AI (or you) could forget to run it, environment differences hide issues, and you lose the “clean-room” guarantee and merge protection.
	•	Only CI: enforceable, but slow & expensive for the inner loop. You’ll push fix-PRs repeatedly, wait on runners, and your agent won’t get immediate feedback.

Practical rule of thumb
	•	Put all logic in npm run prove.
	•	Run it locally for speed (manually or required by your IDE prompts).
	•	Run it in CI to enforce and record results before merging.
	•	Optional: add a pre-commit hook for the cheapest checks (env, lint, typecheck) to fail fast even before prove.

This way the IDE is interchangeable, your logic stays DRY, and your main branch stays safe.
