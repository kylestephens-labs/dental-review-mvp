# Task Execution Order for Prove System Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended order for executing the prove system fix tasks to ensure dependencies are met and fixes are applied efficiently.

## Recommended Execution Order

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Can be done in parallel)
1. **Fix UI Component Export Issues** - `fix-ui-component-exports.md`
   - Quick fix, no dependencies
   - Resolves TypeScript compilation errors

2. **Fix Testing Library Setup** - `fix-testing-library-setup.md`
   - Quick fix, no dependencies  
   - Resolves 23 test failures

3. **Fix Feature Flags Environment Types** - `fix-feature-flags-environment-types.md`
   - Quick fix, no dependencies
   - Resolves 4 test failures

### Phase 2: Component Fixes (Can be done in parallel)
4. **Fix Toggle Group Component Props** - `fix-toggle-group-component-props.md`
   - Depends on: Fix UI Component Export Issues
   - Resolves TypeScript compilation errors

5. **Fix Toast Component Types** - `fix-toast-component-types.md`
   - No dependencies
   - Resolves test type mismatches

### Phase 3: Test Infrastructure Fixes (Can be done in parallel)
6. **Fix Supabase Client Test Mocking** - `fix-supabase-client-test-mocking.md`
   - No dependencies
   - Resolves 3 test failures

7. **Fix Environment Variable Test Setup** - `fix-environment-variable-test-setup.md`
   - No dependencies
   - Resolves 2 test failures

### Phase 4: System Integration
8. **Fix Coverage Generation System** - `fix-coverage-generation-system.md`
   - Depends on: All test fixes must be completed first
   - Resolves coverage system failure

9. **Verify Prove System Functionality** - `verify-prove-system-functionality.md`
   - Depends on: All previous tasks must be completed
   - Final validation that everything works

## Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution
- **Phase 1** tasks can be executed in parallel
- **Phase 2** tasks can be executed in parallel after Phase 1
- **Phase 3** tasks can be executed in parallel after Phase 1

### Sequential Execution
- **Phase 4** tasks must be executed sequentially after all previous phases

## Success Criteria
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- All test failures resolved  
- Coverage generation working
- Prove system fully functional
- No `--no-verify` flags needed

## Estimated Time
- **Phase 1**: 30-45 minutes (parallel execution)
- **Phase 2**: 20-30 minutes (parallel execution)
- **Phase 3**: 30-45 minutes (parallel execution)
- **Phase 4**: 15-30 minutes (sequential execution)
- **Total**: 2-3 hours of focused work

## Notes
- Each task is designed to be self-contained and deliverable in a single Cursor chat session
- Tasks include specific success criteria and validation steps
- Dependencies are clearly marked to prevent execution order issues
- All tasks focus on fixing existing issues rather than adding new features
