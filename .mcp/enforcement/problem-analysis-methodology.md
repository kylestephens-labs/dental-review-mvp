# üîß Problem Analysis Methodology (Non-Functional Tasks)

## Overview
This methodology is used for **non-functional tasks** that don't require testable business logic. These tasks focus on configuration, environment setup, documentation, fixes, and infrastructure.

## üéØ **Task Classification Decision Tree**

### **Decision Rule**: "Does this require writing *testable* business logic?"
- **YES** ‚Üí **Functional Task** ‚Üí Use TDD Methodology
- **NO** ‚Üí **Non-Functional Task** ‚Üí Use Problem Analysis Methodology

### **Functional Task Indicators** (Use TDD)
- ‚úÖ **Business Logic**: Algorithms, calculations, data processing
- ‚úÖ **API Development**: Endpoints, request/response handling
- ‚úÖ **Database Operations**: Queries, transactions, data modeling
- ‚úÖ **Integration**: Third-party services, webhooks, external APIs
- ‚úÖ **Workflow**: Business processes, state machines, automation
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Input validation, business rules, constraints
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, testable code

### **Non-Functional Task Indicators** (Use Problem Analysis)
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Environment variables, config files, settings
- ‚úÖ **Setup**: Installation, deployment, infrastructure setup
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: README, guides, API docs, runbooks
- ‚úÖ **Fixes**: Bug fixes, dependency updates, compatibility issues
- ‚úÖ **Migration**: Data migration, system migration, upgrades
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Servers, databases, monitoring, logging
- ‚úÖ **Build**: Build scripts, CI/CD, packaging, distribution

## üîß **Problem Analysis Methodology**

### **Step 1: ANALYZE** (Understand the Problem)
- [ ] **Gather Information**: What exactly is the problem?
- [ ] **Identify Symptoms**: What are the visible effects?
- [ ] **Check Logs**: What do error logs show?
- [ ] **Reproduce**: Can you reproduce the issue?
- [ ] **Scope**: What's affected by this problem?
- [ ] **Impact**: How critical is this problem?

### **Step 2: IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE** (Find the Source)
- [ ] **Ask Why**: Why is this happening?
- [ ] **Trace Backwards**: What led to this problem?
- [ ] **Check Dependencies**: Are external services involved?
- [ ] **Review Changes**: What changed recently?
- [ ] **Test Hypotheses**: Test your theories about the cause
- [ ] **Confirm Root Cause**: Verify you've found the real source

### **Step 3: FIX DIRECTLY** (Solve the Problem)
- [ ] **Minimal Change**: Make the smallest change that fixes the issue
- [ ] **Don't Over-Engineer**: Avoid adding unnecessary complexity
- [ ] **Direct Solution**: Address the root cause directly
- [ ] **Test the Fix**: Verify the fix works
- [ ] **Document Changes**: Record what you changed and why

### **Step 4: VALIDATE** (Ensure the Fix Works)
- [ ] **Test Locally**: Verify the fix works in your environment
- [ ] **Test in Staging**: Deploy to staging and test
- [ ] **Monitor Production**: Watch for issues after deployment
- [ ] **Verify Symptoms Gone**: Confirm the original problem is resolved
- [ ] **Check Side Effects**: Ensure no new problems were introduced

## üìã **Problem Analysis Checklist**

### **Before Starting Work**
- [ ] **Task Classification**: Confirmed this is a non-functional task
- [ ] **Problem Understanding**: Clear understanding of what needs to be fixed
- [ ] **Root Cause Identified**: Know why the problem exists
- [ ] **Solution Planned**: Have a clear plan for the fix
- [ ] **Validation Strategy**: Know how to verify the fix works

### **During Implementation**
- [ ] **Minimal Changes**: Making only necessary changes
- [ ] **Direct Fix**: Addressing the root cause directly
- [ ] **Testing**: Verifying each change works
- [ ] **Documentation**: Recording what you're changing and why

### **After Implementation**
- [ ] **Local Validation**: Fix works in development
- [ ] **Staging Validation**: Fix works in staging environment
- [ ] **Production Monitoring**: Watching for issues
- [ ] **Problem Resolution**: Original issue is resolved
- [ ] **No Side Effects**: No new problems introduced

## üéØ **Common Non-Functional Task Examples**

### **Configuration Tasks**
```bash
# Example: Fix environment variable issue
Problem: Application can't connect to database
Analysis: Missing DATABASE_URL environment variable
Root Cause: Environment variable not set in production
Fix: Add DATABASE_URL to production environment
Validation: Application connects successfully
```

### **Documentation Tasks**
```bash
# Example: Update API documentation
Problem: API docs are outdated
Analysis: New endpoints added but not documented
Root Cause: Documentation not updated with code changes
Fix: Update API documentation with new endpoints
Validation: Documentation matches current API
```

### **Build/Deployment Tasks**
```bash
# Example: Fix build failure
Problem: CI build failing
Analysis: Build script has incorrect path
Root Cause: Path changed but build script not updated
Fix: Update build script with correct path
Validation: CI build passes successfully
```

### **Dependency Tasks**
```bash
# Example: Update vulnerable dependency
Problem: Security vulnerability in dependency
Analysis: Outdated package with known vulnerability
Root Cause: Package not updated to secure version
Fix: Update package to latest secure version
Validation: Vulnerability scan passes
```

## üö® **Problem Analysis Don'ts**

### **Avoid These Mistakes**
- ‚ùå **Don't**: Fix symptoms instead of root cause
- ‚ùå **Don't**: Over-engineer simple solutions
- ‚ùå **Don't**: Make changes without understanding the problem
- ‚ùå **Don't**: Skip validation steps
- ‚ùå **Don't**: Ignore side effects of changes
- ‚ùå **Don't**: Make multiple changes at once without testing

## ‚úÖ **Problem Analysis Best Practices**

### **Do These Things**
- ‚úÖ **Do**: Understand the problem completely before fixing
- ‚úÖ **Do**: Identify and fix the root cause
- ‚úÖ **Do**: Make minimal, targeted changes
- ‚úÖ **Do**: Test each change thoroughly
- ‚úÖ **Do**: Document what you changed and why
- ‚úÖ **Do**: Monitor for side effects after deployment

## üîÑ **Problem Analysis vs TDD**

| **Problem Analysis** | **TDD** |
|---------------------|---------|
| **For**: Non-functional tasks | **For**: Functional tasks |
| **Approach**: Analyze ‚Üí Identify ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Validate | **Approach**: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor |
| **Focus**: Root cause resolution | **Focus**: Testable business logic |
| **Testing**: Validation of fix | **Testing**: Unit tests for code |
| **Documentation**: What was changed | **Documentation**: How code works |

## üéØ **Success Metrics for Problem Analysis**

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Root Cause Resolution**: 100% of problems fixed at root cause
- **Minimal Changes**: Smallest possible change to fix issue
- **No Side Effects**: No new problems introduced
- **Validation Success**: 100% of fixes validated before deployment

### **Efficiency Metrics**
- **Time to Resolution**: <2 hours for simple fixes
- **First Fix Success**: 90% of fixes work on first attempt
- **Documentation**: 100% of changes documented
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Team understands what was changed

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Problem Analysis**

1. **Classify the task**: Is it functional or non-functional?
2. **If non-functional**: Use Problem Analysis methodology
3. **Analyze**: Understand the problem completely
4. **Identify**: Find the root cause
5. **Fix**: Make minimal, direct changes
6. **Validate**: Ensure the fix works and has no side effects

**Remember: Problem Analysis is about solving problems efficiently and directly, not about writing testable business logic!** üîß
