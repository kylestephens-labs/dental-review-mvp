## Overview
Review and test the AWS RDS migration implementation for the Dental Practice Management MVP. This implementation migrates core business data from Supabase to AWS RDS while keeping Supabase only for lead generation, ensuring full compliance with architecture.md specifications.

## Goal
Test the RDS migration implementation, validate architecture compliance, and provide comprehensive feedback on code quality, security, functionality, and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test all 4 RDS migration scripts (setup, migrate, update-app, cleanup)
- [ ] Verify AWS RDS instance creation and configuration
- [ ] Validate core business tables are created in RDS
- [ ] Confirm Supabase contains only lead generation data
- [ ] Test dual database architecture functionality
- [ ] Review code quality and security best practices
- [ ] Validate error handling and logging
- [ ] Check performance optimizations
- [ ] Review documentation completeness
- [ ] Provide detailed feedback and recommendations

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] RDS migration scripts are complete and executable
- [ ] Architecture compliance with architecture.md is achieved
- [ ] All configuration files are created
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] Testing environment is ready

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All scripts tested and working correctly
- [ ] Architecture compliance validated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance analysis done
- [ ] Code quality assessment provided
- [ ] Detailed feedback and recommendations given
- [ ] Any issues or improvements identified

## Implementation Notes
**RDS Migration Implementation Review:**

**Architecture Compliance:**
- Before: Supabase contained ALL core business tables (incorrect)
- After: AWS RDS contains core business data, Supabase contains only lead generation (correct)
- Compliance: ✅ Fully compliant with architecture.md specification

**Core Scripts to Test:**
1. `scripts/setup-aws-rds.sh` - Creates AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance (db.t4g.micro)
2. `scripts/migrate-to-rds.sh` - Applies core business tables to RDS
3. `scripts/update-app-for-rds.sh` - Updates app to use dual database architecture
4. `scripts/cleanup-supabase.sh` - Removes core tables from Supabase, keeps only leads

**Testing Sequence:**
```bash
npm run rds:setup      # Set up AWS RDS
npm run rds:migrate    # Apply core tables
npm run app:update-rds # Update application
npm run supabase:cleanup # Clean up Supabase
npm run rds:test       # Verify connections
```

**Review Focus Areas:**
- Architecture compliance with architecture.md
- Code quality and best practices
- Security considerations
- Functionality and testing
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation completeness

**Critical Questions:**
1. Does this implementation correctly follow the architecture.md specifications?
2. Are there any security vulnerabilities or concerns?
3. Do all scripts work as expected? Any bugs or issues?
4. Are there any performance optimizations needed?
5. Is the error handling comprehensive enough?
6. Are there any missing tests or validations?
7. Is the documentation clear and complete?

This task is critical for ensuring the dental MVP follows the correct architecture and maintains data separation between core business data (RDS) and lead generation (Supabase).
