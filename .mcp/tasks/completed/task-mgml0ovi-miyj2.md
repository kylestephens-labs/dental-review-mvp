## Overview
Set up environment variable management system with validation and fail-fast boot checks

## Goal
Create a robust environment variable system that ensures all required API keys and configuration are present before the application starts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create .env.example file with all required environment variables
- [x] Implement environment validation script that checks for all required variables
- [x] Boot script fails fast with clear error messages if any required variables are missing
- [x] npm run env:check command passes locally with all variables present
- [x] All API integrations (Stripe, Twilio, SES, Places, GCal, Graph, DB, HMAC) have their required variables defined

## Definition of Ready
- [x] Project architecture is understood
- [x] All required API services are identified
- [x] Environment variable naming conventions are established
- [x] Validation requirements are clear

## Definition of Done
- [x] .env.example file created with all required variables
- [x] Environment validation script implemented
- [x] Boot script fails fast on missing variables
- [x] npm run env:check command works locally
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Documentation updated

## Files Affected
- [x] .env.example
- [x] src/env-check.ts
- [x] package.json (scripts)
- [x] src/__tests__/env-validation.test.ts

## Implementation Notes
Task Analysis:
- Architecture: Supabase backend, Stripe payment processing, Twilio SMS/communication, Google services integration
- Business Goals: Dental practice management, Appointment booking system, Lead intake and management, Payment processing
- Technical Requirements: Environment variable management, Input validation, Error handling, Test-driven development
- MVP Features: Booking system

This task is critical for the dental MVP as it ensures all external service integrations are properly configured before deployment.

## Review Feedback
**Codex Review - Environment Validation Implementation**

✅ **Code Quality Assessment:**
- **Architecture:** Well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- **Type Safety:** Proper TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error reporting with helpful messages
- **Configuration:** Flexible configuration-driven approach

✅ **Implementation Strengths:**
- Environment validation script includes format validation for critical variables
- Clear error messages guide developers to fix issues
- Proper ES module syntax and imports
- Configuration-driven approach allows easy extension

✅ **Security Considerations:**
- No sensitive data exposed in .env.example
- Proper validation prevents invalid configurations
- Clear documentation for developers

⚠️ **Recommendations for Future:**
- Consider adding environment-specific validation (dev vs prod)
- Add support for optional environment variables
- Consider adding validation for environment variable formats (email, URL, etc.)

✅ **Approval:** Implementation meets all acceptance criteria and follows best practices.
